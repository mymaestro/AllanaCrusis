## üöÄ Installation

### Step 1: Download and Setup Files

```bash
# Clone to your web server's document root
cd /var/www/html
git clone https://github.com/mymaestro/musicLibraryDB1.git
cd musicLibraryDB1

# Set proper permissions
chmod 755 .
chmod -R 755 src/includes/
chmod -R 777 public/files/  # For file uploads
```

### Step 2: Database Setup

Create your database and user:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE musicLibraryDB CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'musicLibraryDB'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_secure_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON musicLibraryDB.* TO 'musicLibraryDB'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Choose and import one of the SQL setup files from the `setup/` directory:

- **musicLibraryDB-core.sql** - Minimal setup with empty tables
- **musicLibraryDB-demo.sql** - Full demo with sample compositions and recordings

```sql
USE musicLibraryDB;
SOURCE src/setup/musicLibraryDB-demo.sql;
```

### Step 3: Configuration

Copy the example configuration file and customize it:

```bash
cd includes/
cp config.example.php config.php
```

Edit `config.php` with your settings. Key options include:

- `ORGNAME`: Short name or acronym for your organization
- `ORGDESC`: Full organization name
- `ORGLOGO`: Path to your logo image
- `ORGMAIL`: Contact email address
- `ORGHOME`: Main site URL (with trailing slash)
- `ORGRECORDINGS`: Public URL for recordings
- `ORGPUBLIC`: Directory for recordings (relative to src/includes)
- `ORGPRIVATE`: Directory for parts/distributions (absolute path, outside web root recommended)
- `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, `DB_CHARSET`: Database connection settings
- `REGION`: Default region/homepage
- `DEBUG`: Set to 1 for verbose error logging

### Step 4: File Permissions and Directories

Ensure the web server can write to upload directories:

```bash
mkdir -p public/files/recordings public/files/parts public/files/distributions
chmod -R 755 public/files/
chown -R www-data:www-data public/files/  # Use your web server user
```

### Step 5: First Login

1. Navigate to your installation URL: `https://yourdomain.com/musicLibraryDB/`
2. Click the login icon (üîí) in the navigation bar
3. Use one of the demo user accounts (available if you imported `musicLibraryDB-demo.sql`):

| Username | Password | Role | Description |
|----------|----------|------|-------------|
| `admin` | `admin123` | Administrator | Full system access, user management |
| `librarian` | `librarian123` | Librarian | Can manage music library content |
| `conductor` | `conductor123` | User | Read-only access for conductors |
| `user` | `user123` | User | Basic read-only access |

4. **Important**: Change the default passwords immediately in a production environment!


## üìä Database Schema

### Core Tables

**compositions** - The heart of your music library
- Catalog numbers, titles, composers, arrangers
- Difficulty grades, performance notes, storage locations
- Links to genres, ensembles, and paper sizes

**parts** - Individual instrument parts for each composition
- Links parts to compositions and part types
- Tracks physical copies, page counts, and storage

**concerts** - Performance events
- Links to playgrams (concert programs)
- Venue, date, conductor information

**recordings** - Audio/video recordings of performances
- Links recordings to specific concerts and compositions
- Supports file uploads with metadata extraction

**playgrams** - Concert programs/playlists
- Groups compositions into performance programs
- Supports multiple concerts per playgram

### Supporting Tables

- **part_types** - Instrument part definitions (Flute 1, Trumpet 2, etc.)
- **instruments** - Master list of all instruments
- **genres** - Music classifications (March, Jazz, Classical, etc.)
- **ensembles** - Performing groups (Wind Ensemble, Brass Quintet, etc.)
- **paper_sizes** - Physical dimensions of sheet music
- **users** - System users with role-based permissions

## üé≠ Understanding Music Library Concepts

### For Non-Musicians

If you're not familiar with large group music organization, here are key concepts:

**Composition vs. Parts**
- A **composition** is a complete musical work (like "Stars and Stripes Forever")
- **Parts** are individual sheets for each instrument (Flute 1 part, Trumpet 2 part, etc.)
- One composition might have 20-50 different parts for a full band

**Playgrams (Concert Programs)**
- A **playgram** is a playlist of compositions for a concert
- Like a setlist, it defines the order of pieces to be performed
- One playgram can be used for multiple concert performances

**Ensembles and Instrumentation**
- **Ensembles** are different sized groups (Full Band, Brass Quintet, etc.)
- Each composition specifies which ensemble can perform it
- Different ensembles require different instrumental parts

**Grading System**
- Music is graded 1-6 based on difficulty
- Grade 1: Beginner/Elementary
- Grade 6: Professional/Advanced

- Verify PHP upload settings
- Ensure adequate disk space

**Audio files not playing**

- Check file path configuration
- Verify web server can serve media files

**Permission denied errors**
- Check user roles in database
- Verify session is active
- Confirm role-based access controls (see `public/index.php`)

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode in `config.php`:
```php
define('DEBUG', 1);
```

This provides detailed error logging to help diagnose issues.

*The musicLibraryDB system was designed by and for musicians who understand the unique challenges of managing large music libraries. Whether you're running a community band, school ensemble, or professional organization, this system provides the tools you need to keep your music organized and accessible.*

---

**Key Differences from the Original:**
- All requests are routed through `public/index.php` using a minimal `.htaccess` file.
- Application logic is organized in the `src/` directory, with routing handled in `public/index.php`.
- The project is ready for further modernization (e.g., adding controllers, autoloading, or a lightweight framework).
- The original monolithic structure has been refactored for better maintainability and scalability.

**Migration Note:**
If you are upgrading from the original `musicLibraryDB`, review the new routing and directory structure. Update your Apache configuration to set the document root to the `public/` directory and use the provided `.htaccess` for clean URLs.
