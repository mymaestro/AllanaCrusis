<h2 id="describing-compositions">Describing compositions</h2>

<h3 id="what-is-a-composition">What is a Composition?</h3>
<p>A <strong>composition</strong> in AllanaCrusis represents a complete musical work that encompasses all the essential details needed for library management. This includes basic information such as the title, composer, and arranger, along with publishing details like the publisher and catalog number. Performance data is also captured, including grade level, duration, and instrumentation requirements. The system organizes compositions by genre and ensemble assignment, while also tracking physical details such as paper size and page counts for practical library management.</p>

<em>Figure 1: Stars and Stripes Forever composition</em></p>

<h3 id="composition-vs-parts">Composition vs. parts</h3>
<p>In AllanaCrusis, a composition represents the overall musical work and contains all the metadata about the piece. Everything from the composer and title to the grade level and performance duration is included. Parts, on the other hand, are the individual parts that belong to that composition, such as the first trumpet part, the clarinet parts, the percussion parts, or the conductor’s score. This creates a one-to-many relationship where a single composition can have many different parts associated with it, each representing what a specific instrument or section would play during a performance.</p>

<p><img src="/AllanaCrusis/images/images/composition-part-score.png" alt="Part overview showing relationship to parts" />
<em>Figure 2: Stars and Stripes Forever score</em></p>

<p>Most of the information you need to complete the Compositions page in AllanaCrusis is included in the full score of the publication you are cataloging. Most scores include the composer and arrangers’ names, instrumentation, program notes, and a description of the piece. If you do not have the full score, or it does not include this information, you can find data about most wind band music on the <a href="https://www.windrep.org/">Wind Repertory Project</a> web site. A search link is included in the AllanaCrusis compositions add/edit page.</p>

<h2 id="managing-title-composer-and-arranger-names">Managing title, composer, and arranger names</h2>

<h3 id="the-importance-of-consistent-naming">The importance of consistent naming</h3>

<p>Consistent naming conventions are critical for effective library management. When composer and arranger names are standardized and titles follow formatting rules, your library becomes more searchable and professional. Users can find all works by a composer regardless of who entered the data, while reports and statistics remain accurate and meaningful.</p>

<h3 id="how-allanacrusis-helps-with-name-normalization">How AllanaCrusis helps with name normalization</h3>

<p>AllanaCrusis includes built-in features to maintain consistent names across your library. The autocomplete system activates when you type in composer or arranger fields, presenting suggestions from existing entries to prevent duplicates with spelling variations. Selecting from these suggestions automatically applies “Last, First” formatting for consistency.</p>

<h3 id="name-formatting-standards-and-best-practices">Name formatting standards and best practices</h3>

<p>Use “Last, First Middle” format for composer names. Complex names like “Beethoven, Ludwig van” ensure surnames appear first for better sorting. Single names like “Palestrina” can be entered as-is.</p>

<p>For composition titles, move articles to the end: “The Liberty Bell” becomes “Liberty Bell, The” and “A Lincoln Portrait” becomes “Lincoln Portrait, A.” Apply this to foreign articles too (la, le, les, los, die, der, etc.): “La Marseillaise” becomes “Marseillaise, La.” This prevents all “The” titles from clustering together and makes alphabetical browsing more logical.</p>

<h3 id="handling-special-cases-and-edge-situations">Handling special cases and edge situations</h3>

<p>Use “Traditional” for folk music or unknown authorship. Use “Unknown” when the composer is completely unidentified. For multiple composers, list the primary composer first and note others in the description. For pseudonyms, use the most recognized form and note the real name in the description field.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="searching-and-discovering">Searching and discovering</h2>

<h3 id="making-compositions-easy-to-find">Making compositions easy to find</h3>

<p>Complete the key fields that musicians use to search for music. Focus on titles, composers, arrangers, ensembles, and genres first, then add descriptions with alternate names or memorable details that help users locate specific pieces.</p>

<h3 id="essential-fields-for-searchability">Essential fields for searchability</h3>

<p>Focus on these core fields to maximize findability. The <strong>title</strong> field should include the complete title plus any common alternate names in the description. For <strong>composer</strong> names, consistent “Last, First” formatting ensures users find works whether they search “Sousa” or “John Philip Sousa.” The <strong>genre</strong> field helps users browse by style, while <strong>grade level</strong> enables filtering by difficulty. Don’t skip the <strong>description</strong> field - it’s searchable and perfect for alternate titles, movement names, or other terms users might remember.</p>

<h3 id="practical-search-optimization-strategies">Practical search optimization strategies</h3>

<p>Include subtitle information, for example: “Nimrod” in the description for “Enigma Variations.” Add movement names for multi-movement works. Use the description field for memorable lyrics: add “O beautiful for spacious skies” to help users find “America the Beautiful.” Include instrumentation details for unusual scoring, and mention any special performance requirements that users might search for.</p>

<h3 id="common-search-scenarios-to-support">Common search scenarios to support</h3>

<p>Users typically search by composer when planning concerts around specific periods or styles. They search by title when they remember part of a name, by grade level when selecting appropriate repertoire, and by genre when building themed programs. Support partial searches by avoiding abbreviations in titles - write “Symphony” not “Sym.” and “Overture” not “Ov.” This makes your library work the way musicians think.</p>

<h3 id="grade-level-and-duration-for-program-planning">Grade level and duration for program planning</h3>

<p>Accurate <strong>grade level</strong> and <strong>duration</strong> data helps you promote effective concert planning. Directors use grade levels to match repertoire difficulty to ensemble abilities, while duration information helps create properly timed programs. AllanaCrusis’s <strong>Playgram Builder</strong> page uses these fields along with other composition metadata to help musical directors build balanced concert programs automatically.</p>
