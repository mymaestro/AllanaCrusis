# API Documentation

*Coming Soon*

AllanaCrusis API documentation will be available here for developers who want to integrate with the system or build custom tools.

## Planned API Features

- **REST API**: JSON endpoints for all major functions
- **Authentication**: Token-based API access
- **Webhooks**: Event notifications for system changes
- **SDKs**: Client libraries for popular programming languages

## Current Integration Options

While the formal API is in development, you can:

1. **Database Access**: Direct database queries for read operations
2. **File System**: Access to uploaded files and exports
3. **Custom Extensions**: Modify the existing PHP codebase

For more information about current integration possibilities, contact your system administrator.
