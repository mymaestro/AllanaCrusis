## Understanding Compositions

### What is a Composition?
A composition in AllanaCrusis represents a complete musical work, including:
- **Basic information**: Title, composer, arranger
- **Publishing details**: Publisher, catalog number
- **Performance data**: Grade level, duration, instrumentation
- **Organization**: Genre, ensemble assignment
- **Physical details**: Paper size, page counts

### Composition vs. Parts
- **Composition**: The overall musical work and its metadata
- **Parts**: Individual instrument parts that belong to the composition
- **Relationship**: One composition can have many parts

- **Select from list** to ensure consistency
- **Automatic formatting** to "Last, First" format

![Composer autocomplete showing suggestions](images/screenshots/compositions-add-edit.png)
*Figure 7: Composer autocomplete suggesting existing entries*

#### Name Formatting Rules
- **Standard format**: "Last, First Middle"
- **Multiple names**: "Beethoven, Ludwig van"
- **Titles and suffixes**: "Bach, Johann Sebastian"
- **Single names**: "Palestrina" (historical figures)

#### Special Cases
- **Traditional works**: Use "Traditional"
- **Unknown composer**: Use "(n/a)"

1. **Prepare clean data** in required format
2. **Test with small batch** first
3. **Validate required fields** are present
4. **Check for duplicates** before importing

## Integration with Other Functions

### Connection to Parts Management
- **Automatic relationships**: Parts link to their composition
- **Inherited metadata**: Parts get information from composition
- **Instrumentation tracking**: Composition shows what parts exist

### Performance Tracking
- **Concert programming**: Link compositions to performances
- **Usage statistics**: Track which works are performed most
- **Planning tools**: Use metadata for concert planning

### Reporting and Analysis
- **Collection statistics**: Analyze by composer, genre, grade level
- **Acquisition planning**: Identify gaps in collection
- **Usage reports**: See which compositions are accessed most

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Duplicate Compositions
**Problem**: Same composition entered multiple times
**Solution**: 
- Use search before adding new compositions
- Check alternate titles and spellings
- Merge or remove duplicates as appropriate

### Missing Information
**Problem**: Incomplete metadata affecting usefulness
**Solution**:
- Research using Wind Repertory Project or other sources
- Check physical scores for missing information
- Flag for later completion if information unavailable

### Naming Inconsistencies
**Problem**: Same composer with different name formats
**Solution**:
- Use autocomplete to maintain consistency
- Run periodic reports to identify variations
- Standardize using bulk update tools
