## Understanding compositions

### What is a Composition?
A **composition** in AllanaCrusis represents a complete musical work that encompasses all the essential details needed for library management. This includes basic information such as the title, composer, and arranger, along with publishing details like the publisher and catalog number. Performance data is also captured, including grade level, duration, and instrumentation requirements. The system organizes compositions by genre and ensemble assignment, while also tracking physical details such as paper size and page counts for practical library management.

### Composition vs. parts
Understanding the relationship between compositions and parts is fundamental to using AllanaCrusis effectively. A composition represents the overall musical work and contains all the metadata about the pieceâ€”everything from the composer and title to the grade level and performance duration. Parts, on the other hand, are the conductor's score, and individual instrument parts that belong to that composition, such as the first trumpet part, the clarinet parts, or the percussion parts. This creates a one-to-many relationship where a single composition can have many different parts associated with it, each representing what a specific instrument or section would play during a performance.
