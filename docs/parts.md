## Understanding Parts

### What are Parts?
Parts are individual instrument components of a musical composition:
- **Individual instrument parts**: Flute 1, Trumpet 2, Percussion, etc.
- **Physical tracking**: Count of original printed parts
- **Digital files**: PDF or other electronic formats
- **Metadata**: Page counts, paper sizes, descriptions

### Parts vs. Compositions
- **Composition**: The overall musical work
- **Parts**: Individual components needed for performance
- **Relationship**: One composition has many parts

![Parts relationship diagram](images/screenshots/parts-overview.png)
*Figure 1: How parts relate to compositions and instruments*

### Types of Parts
- **Individual instruments**: Specific to one instrument
- **Condensed parts**: Multiple instruments on one part (Flute 1&2)
- **Rhythm section**: Special parts for jazz or contemporary music
- **Conductor materials**: Scores, piano reductions
- **Auxiliary materials**: Program notes, technical requirements
