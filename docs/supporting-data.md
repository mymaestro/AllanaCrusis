## Overview of Supporting Data

### What is Supporting Data?
Supporting data consists of the reference lists and categories that organize your music library:

- **Instruments**: Define what instruments are available for parts
- **Ensembles**: Specify which groups use the library
- **Genres**: Categorize musical styles and types
- **Paper Sizes**: Track physical dimensions of printed music
- **Part Types**: Classify different kinds of musical parts

### Why Supporting Data Matters
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform data entry across the library
- **Organization**: Helps users find and filter content effectively
- **Reporting**: Enables meaningful statistics and analysis
- **Workflow**: Streamlines the process of adding new compositions

## Instruments

### Purpose of Instrument Management
The instrument list defines all possible instruments that can be assigned to musical parts. This creates consistency in naming and enables effective searching and filtering.

### Viewing Instruments
1. Navigate to **MATERIALS > Instruments**
2. Browse the complete list of available instruments
3. Use the search/filter to find specific instruments
4. View instrument categories and groupings

![Instruments list showing categories and search options](images/screenshots/instruments.png)
*Figure 2: Instrument management interface*

### Adding New Instruments
**For Librarians and Managers:**

1. **Click "Add Instrument"**
2. **Fill in instrument details**:
   - **Name**: Full instrument name (e.g., "Clarinet in Bâ™­")
   - **Short name**: Abbreviated version (e.g., "Cl")
   - **Category**: Instrument family (woodwinds, brass, etc.)
   - **Sort order**: Position in lists
   - **Active status**: Whether to show in selections

3. **Save the new instrument**

### Instrument Categories
Common categories include:
- **Woodwinds**: Flutes, clarinets, saxophones, oboes, bassoons
- **Brass**: Trumpets, horns, trombones, tubas
- **Percussion**: Timpani, mallet instruments, auxiliary percussion
- **Strings**: Violin, viola, cello, bass (if applicable)
- **Other**: Piano, harp, electronics, vocals

### Managing Instrument Names
**Best Practices:**
- Use standard instrument names
- Include key/pitch designations (e.g., "Horn in F")
- Be consistent with abbreviations
- Consider international naming conventions
- Include numbered parts (e.g., "Trumpet 1", "Trumpet 2")

## Ensembles

### Purpose of Ensemble Management
Ensembles define which musical groups use your library. This helps organize compositions by intended performing group and manage access permissions.

### Common Ensemble Types
- **Wind Ensemble**: Standard concert band instrumentation
- **Symphony Orchestra**: Full orchestral forces
- **Chamber Groups**: Small ensembles (quintet, sextet, etc.)
- **Jazz Ensemble**: Big band and jazz combo arrangements
- **Marching Band**: Field show and parade music
- **Choir**: Vocal ensembles

### Adding Ensembles
1. **Navigate to MATERIALS > Ensembles**
2. **Click "Add Ensemble"**
3. **Enter ensemble information**:
   - **Name**: Full ensemble name
   - **Short name**: Abbreviation
   - **Description**: Details about the group
   - **Active status**: Whether currently in use

![Ensemble management interface](images/screenshots/ensembles.png)
*Figure 4: Ensemble setup and configuration*

### Ensemble Assignment
- Compositions are typically assigned to one primary ensemble
- Some pieces may be suitable for multiple ensembles
- Assignment affects search filtering and organization
- Users may have access restricted by ensemble membership

---

## Genres

### Purpose of Genre Classification
Genres help categorize musical styles and make it easier for users to find appropriate repertoire for their needs.

### Standard Genre Categories
Common genres include:

#### Concert Music
- **Wind Ensemble**: Standard concert band repertoire
- **Symphonic Transcription**: Orchestra pieces arranged for band
- **Contemporary**: Modern classical compositions
- **Light Classical**: Accessible classical works

#### Popular and Seasonal
- **March**: Military and concert marches
- **Christmas**: Holiday and seasonal music
- **Pop/Show Tunes**: Popular and Broadway arrangements
- **Film Music**: Movie soundtrack arrangements

#### Educational and Functional
- **Method Book**: Educational materials
- **Warm-up**: Exercises and technical studies
- **Ceremonial**: Processionals, hymns, patriotic music

### Managing Genres
1. **Go to MATERIALS > Genres**
2. **Review existing categories**
3. **Add new genres** as needed for your collection
4. **Organize by frequency of use**

## Paper Sizes

### Purpose of Paper Size Tracking
Paper sizes help librarians manage physical storage, copying, and distribution of printed music.

### Common Paper Sizes
- **Folio (9" x 12")**: Most common for band and orchestral music
- **Letter (8.5" x 11")**: Standard copy paper size
- **Legal (8.5" x 14")**: Extended length for complex scores
- **Tabloid (11" x 17")**: Large format for full scores
- **A4 (210mm x 297mm)**: International standard
- **Custom sizes**: For special or historical materials

### Paper Size Management
1. **Navigate to MATERIALS > Paper Sizes**
2. **View existing size definitions**
3. **Add custom sizes** if needed
4. **Set default sizes** for different types of music

![Paper size configuration interface](images/screenshots/paper-sizes.png)
*Figure 6: Paper size definitions and settings*

### Impact on Library Management
- **Storage planning**: Calculate shelf space requirements
- **Copying costs**: Different sizes have different costs
- **Distribution**: Affects packaging and mailing
- **Digital scanning**: Determines scan settings and file sizes

## Part Types

### Purpose of Part Type Classification
Part types categorize the different kinds of musical parts and materials in your library.

### Common Part Types
- **Individual Parts**: Single instrument parts
- **Condensed Score**: Reduced score for conductor reference
- **Full Score**: Complete conductor's score
- **Piano Reduction**: Piano accompaniment version
- **Vocal Parts**: Choral or solo vocal lines
- **Method Materials**: Educational and exercise materials

### Managing Part Types
1. **Go to MATERIALS > Part Types**
2. **Review current categories**
3. **Add specialized types** for your collection
4. **Set ordering preferences** for display

![Part types management interface](images/screenshots/part-types.png)
*Figure 7: Part type categories and configuration*

### Part Type Applications
- **Inventory tracking**: Know what materials you have
- **Distribution planning**: Different types have different distribution needs
- **Access control**: Some types may be restricted to certain users
- **Workflow organization**: Different processes for different part types
